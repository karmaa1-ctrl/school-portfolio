Project Description
Thriftee is a transformative solution designed to modernize thrift store operations by providing an exclusive online platform. This user-friendly application aims to bridge the gap between thrift store owners and a larger, digital-savvy customer base. 
By leveraging features such as home, profile, shops, categorization, search filters, notifications, and place order, Thriftee enhances the shopping experience for customers and streamlines the sales process for store owners. 
The project focuses on addressing the limitations of relying solely on social media for marketing and sales, thereby boosting visibility and profitability for thrift stores.

Usage Instructions
The Thriftee prototype showcases the application's main features and user flow. It includes a welcome screen with the Thriftee logo and slogan, a sign-up or log-in screen for account management, 
and a home screen that serves as the central hub for navigation. Users can access their profile, search for products, view reviews, and add items to their cart. 
The prototype demonstrates the seamless transition between browsing, selecting, and purchasing products, emphasizing user-friendly design and intuitive navigation to enhance the overall shopping experience.

Main Screen: 
The application design flow starts with a welcome screen, which serves as the entry point for users. From the welcome screen, users are directed to the sign-up page. 
After completing the sign-up process, users are taken to the personal information input page, where they can provide additional details about themselves. 
Finally, users are directed to the home page, which serves as the main interface for the application.

Purchasing Order:
After selecting items to purchase, users can add them to their cart. From the cart, users can review the order summary, which displays the items, quantities, and total cost. 
Once the user is satisfied with the order summary, they can proceed to complete the order, which marks the final step in the purchasing process.

Search Feature, Feedbacks & Reviews:
The application's search feature allows users to search for content and view detailed information, including user reviews and ratings. Users can provide feedback on the content they have interacted with, 
and this user-generated feedback is then aggregated and displayed as part of the search results.
